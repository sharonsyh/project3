A relational database is the most common means of data storage and retrieval in the modern age. A relational database model stores data into one or more tables, where each table has columns and rows. The columns represent a value that can be attributed to an entry (such as color, name, or ID) and the rows represent individual entries or records (such as Paoletti, my_cat, or BBB_1695). You may find it helpful to think about rows as objects and columns as descriptors for those objects. For instance, the table pictured below has each row corresponding to a car (a data type), and the columns group a car’s vendors, model, etc. such that this information can be easily retrieved. Rows in relational databases are also called records or tuples, but in this project we will use the terminology “row” for consistency.

This is a program to emulate a basic relational database with an interface based on a subset of a standard query language. This code makes use of multiple interacting data structures.
